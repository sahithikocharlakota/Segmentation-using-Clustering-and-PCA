# Segmentation-using-Clustering-and-PCA
The data collected has many variables which makes it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. The very first step is to perform EDA and then performing Clustering, PCA as per the requirements in the data. 
1. Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation using clustering techniques.
2. Identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in the Primary Census data.

Clustering:

Digital Ads Data:

The ads24x7 is a Digital Marketing company which has now got seed funding of $10 Million. They are expanding their wings in Marketing Analytics. They collected data from their Marketing Intelligence team and now wants you (their newly appointed data analyst) to segment type of ads based on the features provided. Use Clustering procedure to segment ads into homogeneous groups.

The following three features are commonly used in digital marketing:

CPM = (Total Campaign Spend / Number of Impressions) * 1,000. Note that the Total Campaign Spend refers to the 'Spend' Column in the dataset and the Number of Impressions refers to the 'Impressions' Column in the dataset. 

CPC = Total Cost (spend) / Number of Clicks.  Note that the Total Cost (spend) refers to the 'Spend' Column in the dataset and the Number of Clicks refers to the 'Clicks' Column in the dataset. 

CTR = Total Measured Clicks / Total Measured Ad Impressions x 100. Note that the Total Measured Clicks refers to the 'Clicks' Column in the dataset and the Total Measured Ad Impressions refers to the 'Impressions' Column in the dataset. 


PCA:

PCA FH (FT): Primary census abstract for female headed households excluding institutional households (India & States/UTs - District Level), Scheduled tribes - 2011 PCA for Female Headed Household Excluding Institutional Household. The Indian Census has the reputation of being one of the best in the world. The first Census in India was conducted in the year 1872. This was conducted at different points of time in different parts of the country. In 1881 a Census was taken for the entire country simultaneously. Since then, Census has been conducted every ten years, without a break. Thus, the Census of India 2011 was the fifteenth in this unbroken series since 1872, the seventh after independence and the second census of the third millennium and twenty first century. The census has been uninterruptedly continued despite of several adversities like wars, epidemics, natural calamities, political unrest, etc. The Census of India is conducted under the provisions of the Census Act 1948 and the Census Rules, 1990. The Primary Census Abstract which is important publication of 2011 Census gives basic information on Area, Total Number of Households, Total Population, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes Population, Population in the age group 0-6, Literates, Main Workers and Marginal Workers classified by the four broad industrial categories, namely, (i) Cultivators, (ii) Agricultural Laborers, (iii) Household Industry Workers, and (iv) Other Workers and also Non-Workers. The characteristics of the Total Population include Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Institutional and Houseless Population and are presented by sex and rural-urban residence. Census 2011 covered 35 States/Union Territories, 640 districts, 5,924 sub-districts, 7,935 Towns and 6,40,867 Villages.
The data collected has so many variables thus making it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. You are tasked to perform detailed EDA and identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in data. Use Sklearn only.
